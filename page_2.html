            <h3>1.Sri Lankan Elephant</h3>
            <p><img src="Images\52A2224-2-Gajaba-768x512.jpg"> Sri Lankan subspecies is the largest and also the darkest of the Asian elephants, with patches of depigmentation areas with no skin color on its ears, face, trunk and belly. Once found throughout the tear shaped island at the bottom of Indias southern tip, these elephants are now being pushed into smaller areas as development activities clear forests and disrupt their ancient migratory routes.The herd size in Sri Lanka ranges from 12-20 individuals or more. It is led by the oldest female, or matriarch. In Sri Lanka, herds have been reported to contain nursing units, consisting of lactating females and their young, and juvenile care units, containing females with juveniles. The Sri Lankan elephant population has fallen almost 65% since the turn of the 19th century. Today, the Sri Lanka elephant is protected under the Sri Lankan law and killing one carries the death penalty.</p>
            <h3>2.Sri Lankan Sloth Bear</h3>
            <p><img src="Images\15-relaxing-after-a-hearty-meal-of-termites-768x512.jpg">The sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) was originally classified as belonging to the sloth family (Megalonychidae and Bradypodidae).They are nocturnal species who set about their daily forage, as dusk begins to fall. The sloth bear is a shy and reclusive animal, and is only found in pairs during courting (breeding) or when one encounters a mother and cub. Occasionally, they are also found in pairs when there are seasonal bounties of rich food, as during the season when trees as 'Palu' and 'Weera' yield fruit. It is the only member of the bear family that carries the cub on its back. The sloth bear has to quench its thirst every night and cannot go on for prolonged periods of time without water. Sloth bears use a wide variety of facial expression and calls to communicate with one another. The subspecies Melursus ursinus inornatus is endemic to Sri Lanka.</p>
            <h3>3.Purple Faced Langur</h3>
            <p><img src="Images\horton-plains-national.jpg">The purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus ), also known as the purple-faced leaf monkey, is a species of Old World monkey that is endemic to Sri Lanka. The animal is a long-tailed arboreal species, identified by a mostly brown appearance, dark face (with paler lower face) and a very shy nature. The species was once highly prevalent, found in suburban Colombo and the "wet zone" villages (areas with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, whilst rain deluges occur during the monsoon seasons), but rapid urbanization has led to a significant decrease in the population level of the monkeys. It had traditionally been classified within the lutung genus Trachypithecus but was moved to the genus Semnopithecus based on DNA evidence indicating that is it more closely related to the gray langurs.</p>
            <h3>4.Sri Lankan Jungle Fowl</h3>
            <p><img src="Images\ceylon-jungle-fowl.jpg">Adult male has boldly streaked plumage. Breast and upperparts are fiery yellow to coppery-orange, finely streaked golden. Lower breast, scapulars and back sides are darker bright copper.Belly, flanks and tail are dark glossy purplish-black. Flight feathers are blackish. The tail is bushy with some longer central rectrices forming with all the tail feathers an elegant panache. Lower back and rump show pale blue feathers turning metallic darker blue on the uppertail coverts.On the head, the bare face and the two hanging wattles are bright red. Starting from forehead and extending over the top of the crown, a fleshy red crest shows central yellow patch. Chin and throat are purplish-blue.Bill is yellow to horn-coloured. Eyes are yellow. Legs and feet are red.   </p>
            <h3>5.Sri Lankan Blue Magpie</h3>
            <p><img src="Images\1.jpg">The Sri Lanka blue magpie or Ceylon magpie (Urocissa ornata ) is a brightly coloured member of the family Corvidae, found exclusively in Sri Lanka. This species is adapted to hunting in the dense canopy, where it is highly active and nimble. Its flight is rather weak, though, and is rarely used to cover great distances. In spite of the Sri Lanka blue magpie's ability to adapt to the presence of humans, it is classified as vulnerable to extinction due to the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat of dense primary forest in the wet zone of southern Sri Lanka.</p>
            <h3>6.Toque Macaque</h3>
            <p><img src="Images\monkey-8063293_640.jpg">he Toque Macaque is a commonly found monkey in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Toque Macaques (Macaca sinica) are the smallest species of Macaca, a golden-brown coloured monkey, endemic to Sri Lanka. Locally known as the “Rilawa”, it is easily distinguished by the toque-shaped swirl of hair on the top of its head, with the amount of hair on the top of the head being geographically variable within their range.There are three recognised subspecies of Toque Macaque; dry zone Toque Macaque (M.s. sinica), wet zone Toque Macaque (M.s. aurifrons) and the highland Toque Macaque (M.s. opisthomelas).</p>
